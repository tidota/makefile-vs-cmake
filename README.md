# Makefile vs CMake

# Makefile

A kind of recipe to instruct how the source code is compiled to generate a resulting file such as an executable.

In this repository, you can find an example.
```
cd makefile
make
./hello
```

# CMake

A kind of recipe to generate a Makefile. 

In this repository, you can find an example.
```
cd cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./hello
```
See the last two steps are the same.
